# Project Overview: PredictFX
DeepQuantFX is a full-stack deep learning application designed to forecast Forex (foreign exchange) rates using a Hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture, coupled with MLOps best practices and real-time deployment.

This project combines:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for capturing local temporal patterns,

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) units for long-range dependencies in time series data,

A robust MLOps pipeline for automated training, evaluation, and deployment using platforms like Vertex AI and MLflow,

And a user-facing Gradio web interface for real-time Forex inference.

The application integrates multiple data sources — including OHLCV forex data and macroeconomic indicators — and showcases advanced evaluation visualizations, data augmentation techniques, and TensorBoard-based model monitoring.
