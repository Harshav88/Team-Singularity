# Project Overview: PredictFX

This project explores the prediction of the USD/CAD exchange rate using deep learning models informed by macroeconomic indicators from both the U.S. and Canada.

## Overview

We leverage:

- Daily Forex data (USD/CAD) from Yahoo Finance  
- Monthly macroeconomic indicators from FRED API  
- Deep learning architectures:
  - MLP (Multilayer Perceptron)
  - LSTM
  - TCN (Temporal Convolutional Network)
  - Seq2Seq LSTM
  - Attention-based LSTM

Each model is designed to predict future USD/CAD exchange rates based on historical macroeconomic trends. During testing, the USDCAD input is masked to simulate real-world forecasting.

## Dependencies

```bash
!pip install yfinance fredapi openpyxl keras-tcn pytorch-tabnet
!pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
